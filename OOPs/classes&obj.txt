Class:

A class is a blueprint or a template for creating objects. It defines the properties (attributes) and behaviors (methods) that objects of that class will have.
Classes are like a set of instructions for creating objects with specific characteristics and behaviors.
They act as a blueprint because you can create multiple objects based on the same class, and they will all have the same structure and behavior.

Object:

An object is an instance of a class. It is a concrete realization of the class's blueprint, with its own unique data and state.
Objects can be thought of as individual entities that have their own data (attributes) and can perform actions (methods) as defined by the class.
Objects allow you to work with and manipulate data in a structured and organized way.


-->>In summary, a class defines the structure and behavior of objects, while objects are instances of classes that hold specific data and can perform actions based on the class's definition.
