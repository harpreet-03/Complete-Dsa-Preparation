A stack is a fundamental data structure that operates on the principle of Last In, First Out (LIFO). Imagine a stack of plates in a cafeteria. The plate you place on top last is the one you can take off first. This concept translates to how data elements are added and removed in a stack data structure.

Here are some key points about stacks:

Operations: The main operations performed on a stack are push and pop. Push adds an element to the top of the stack, while pop removes and returns the top element.

Implementation: Stacks can be implemented using arrays or linked lists. Array implementation offers faster access but has fixed size limitations, while linked lists provide dynamic sizing but slower access.

Applications: Stacks are used in various applications, including:

- Function call handling: Keeping track of function calls and returning to the correct calling function.
- Expression evaluation: Evaluating expressions in postfix notation (e.g., calculators).
- Undo/Redo functionality: Implementing undo and redo actions in software.
- Browsing history: Keeping track of visited web pages in a browser.
