Tries:
------

- A Trie, also known as a prefix tree, is a type of search tree used in computing. 
- It is a tree-like data structure that is often used to store a dynamic set or associative array where the keys are usually strings.


What is a Trie?
---------------

A Trie is a data structure that is used to store a collection of strings in a way that allows for efficient retrieval of strings that match a given prefix.


How does a Trie work?
---------------------

A Trie works by creating a tree-like data structure where each node in the tree represents a string. Each node has a set of child nodes, and each child node represents a string that is one character longer than the string represented by its parent node.

Key characteristics of a Trie:
------------------------------

- Root node: The root node of a Trie represents the empty string.
- Child nodes: Each child node represents a string that is one character longer than the string represented by its parent node.
- Edges: The edges between nodes in a Trie represent the characters in the strings.
- Leaf nodes: Leaf nodes in a Trie represent the actual strings in the collection.


Advantages of Tries:
--------------------

- Efficient search: Tries allow for efficient search of strings that match a given prefix.
- Fast insertion and deletion: Tries allow for fast insertion and deletion of strings.
- Space efficiency: Tries can be more space-efficient than other data structures, such as hash tables, for storing large collections of strings.


Disadvantages of Tries:
------------------------

- Complexity: Tries can be complex to implement and manage, especially for large collections of strings.
- Memory usage: Tries can use a significant amount of memory, especially for large collections of strings.
