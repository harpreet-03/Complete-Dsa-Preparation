// why we nee AVL Trees, whats its importance ?

/*
 * AVL trees are important because they provide a way to maintain the balance of a binary search tree, which is crucial for efficient data retrieval. In an AVL tree, the heights of the two child subtrees of any node differ by at most one. This property ensures that the tree remains balanced, even after insertions and deletions.
 * 
 * The main idea behind the AVL tree is to maintain the balance of the tree by performing rotations when necessary. These rotations help to keep the tree height-balanced, which in turn ensures that the tree remains efficient for data retrieval operations.

 /*
 Example:
 
 public class AVLTree {
    private Node root;

    private class Node {
        int key;
        Node left;
        Node right;
        int height;

        Node(int key) {
            this.key = key;
            this.height = 1;
        }
    }

    // Other methods like insert, delete, search, etc.
}
  * 

In this implementation, each node of the tree stores its key, left and right child nodes, and its height. The height is used to maintain the balance of the tree.

The insert and delete operations in an AVL tree are more complex than in a simple binary search tree, as they require rebalancing the tree to maintain the AVL property. However, this extra complexity is worth it for the improved performance in data retrieval.

In summary, AVL trees are important because they provide a way to maintain the balance of a binary search tree, which is crucial for efficient data retrieval. They are more complex to implement than simple binary search trees, but the improved performance is worth the extra complexity.
