-A min heap is a binary heap where the root node has the minimum value.
-The highest priority is assigned to the lowest value, meaning that the smallest element is always at the root of the heap.
-Each parent node has a value less than or equal to the values of its children.


Max Heap:

-A max heap is a binary heap where the root node has the maximum value.
-The highest priority is assigned to the highest value, meaning that the largest element is always at the root of the heap.
-Each parent node has a value greater than or equal to the values of its children.
