The most efficient sorting algorithms for large data:

1. Quicksort:

Average time complexity: O(n log n)
Space complexity: O(log n)
Best performance: For large, random data sets
Worst case: O(n^2) (rare)

2. Merge Sort:

Time complexity: O(n log n) (guaranteed)
Space complexity: O(n)
Best performance: For stable sorting and external sorting
Worst case: O(n log n)

3. Radix Sort:

Time complexity: O(n) (best case)
Space complexity: O(n + k)
Best performance: For sorting integers with a limited range of values
Worst case: O(n^2) (rare)

4. Heap Sort:

Time complexity: O(n log n)
Space complexity: O(1) (not including heap storage)
Best performance: For in-memory sorting with limited space
Worst case: O(n log n)
