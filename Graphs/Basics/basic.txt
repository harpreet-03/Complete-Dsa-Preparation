Graphs
------

- It is basically a network of nodes.
- Each node in graphs is called = Vertex.
- A structure / a line that connects two vertices is called an Edge.


Edges:
------

- Directed Edges: An edge that has a direction associated with it is called a directed edge.

    A -------------> B

- Undirected Edges: An edge that does not have a direction associated with it is called an Undirected Edge.

    A -------------- B

- Bi-directional: We can move in both direction.

    A <---------------- B
    A ----------------> B


Types: 

1. Weighted Graphs:

- A graph in which each edge has a weight associated with it is called a weighted graph.
- The weight of an edge is a number that is associated with it. It can be a positive or negative number.
- The weight of an edge can be used to represent the cost of using that edge.
- The weight of an edge can be used to represent the distance between the two vertices that are connected
by that edge.

2. Unweighted Graphs: 

- A graph in which each edge does not have a weight associated with it is called a weighted graph.
