‚ùñ Depth first search:
----------------------

- In Depth First Search (or DFS) for a graph, we traverse all adjacent vertices one by one. 
- This is similar to a tree, where we first completely traverse the left subtree and then move to the right subtree. 
- The key difference is that, unlike trees, graphs may contain cycles (a node may be visited more than once). 
- To avoid processing a node multiple times, we use a boolean visited array.
